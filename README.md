# Hangman

*Hangman is a word guessing game. Try to fill a word letter by letter without making too many mistakes.*   

It was made with pygame using OOP as a side project. We started with word guessing and moved on to creating a full user interface with different difficulties and word categories.
Then, we added a money system to keep things spicy and a light mode for non programmers. ðŸ˜‰
